     <h1>The motive.</h1>
     <p> In high school, I was taught with Pascal - a pretty outdated programming language. However, I am determined to not let this become a setback to my enthusiasm for programming. That's why I learn how to make a website. It is easy to comprehend and practical - the 2 things that lack in most of my Informatics periods in school. Of course, I am not set on website development only, as I am eager to broaden my horizon with new skillsets and more challenging projects. </p>

            <p>The base is that I am an English major, the modifier is programming , and the flavour; it depends on the things that matter to my daily life. I am currently learning website development. However, I am aslo fascinated by data analytics and computer science. </P>
            <p> While I spend most of my time in school, I do spend a lot of spare time learning more about the things that make me tick - programming and filmmaking. </p>

        <p> I have worked on multiple HTML projects. And this website is the most notable of them all. I'm looking forward to advance my HTML skills by engaging in more projects. </p>

        <h3>CSS Styling</h3>
        <p>To a website developer, if HTML is the bread then CSS is definitely the butter. I found learning CSS very interesting because CSS allows me to design my product to my preference. Futhermore, who wouldn't be wowed by a gorgeous website. </p>

        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>Most people learn either JavaScript or Python before becoming specialized in a certain field such as web development. However, my story was quite an exception. I learn JavaScript to supplement my website development projects. As a result, my javascript remains a work in progress. My resolution is to improve my JavaScript skill in order to venture to many different domains of computer science. </p>
